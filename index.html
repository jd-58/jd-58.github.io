                    <p>Hello! I am currently a student at Oregon State University, pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science.
                    After graduating from the University of Virginia with a degree in Economics in 2021,
                    I spent two years as a Business Development Analyst. After completing a few data analysis projects
                        using Python, I realized that my true passion is coding, which led me to pursue a degree in
                        Computer Science. <a class="navigation-anchor" id="projects-anchor"></a>
                        I'm projected to graduate in August 2026 and am excited about finding
                        internship opportunities. I believe my unique mix of skills and experiences would be a
                        great addition to your team!</p>
